Personal project I played during college time. If anyone think useful, he/she can use without any  condition. I will be happy to give the code.

Written in PHP.

Description:
---------------------------------------
Use Twitter API to search the keyword (which I call "a trend") that a user enters and let him join the group of people who are interested in that trend, and let them connected until they no longer want to communicate. It is sort of like a dynamic grouping of people based on their interest happened at a particular time.

Developed in the hope of creating next generation of forums on web. Implemented by PHP from scratch and used Zend components to support some features. JQuery is used for AJAX requests and UI features. (This project can be seen upon request)
