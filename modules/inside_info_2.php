			FollowTheTrend is inspired by the idea which is "Connecting people based on the interest happened at a particular time". That means one might be interested in football for now but in few hours he might be interested in other thing. So as long as he is interested in football, FollowTheTrend allows him to connect with people who are interested in football at that time. Once he stops the interest in football, he will not be connected with them anymore.
			<p>
			In each trend, you can see the latest tweets about that trend and the links submitted by people. You can say whatever you want by posting on bulletin board. If you want to refer to a person, you will have to use @ character in front of the person\'s name so that the message on bulletin board is highlighted in that person side. You will be notified every time your name is referred on the bulletin board.
