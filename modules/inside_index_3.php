<h1>What is FollowTheTrend</h1>
<p>
FollowTheTrend is a web application that allows you communicate with people who are interested in the same thing as you.	
</p>
<p>
You have to create or join the active trends and you can be in that trend as long as you want to be connected with people of same interest. Once you leave from that trend, your name will disappear in the "people who are interested in this" list of that trend. So you will not be notified if someone mentioned you on the bulletin board since you are not interested in it anymore.
</p>	
<p>
In each trend, you can see the latest tweets about that trend, links being shared and you can post whatever you want to say on bulletin board. You will be notified if someone refers your name on the bulletin board.
